1.
The string itself is immutable but the label can change.
 Assigning a new value to an existing variable is perfectly valid.
2.
The in-place operator += can also be used. The string on the right is concatenated after the string variable on the left.
 To add a string to the end of a string variable,We use the += operator.
3.
There are two types of indexing : 1. Basic Slicing and indexing : Consider the syntax x[obj] where x is the array and obj is the index.
 Slice object is the index in case of basic slicing.
4.
 Indexing is used to obtain individual elements.
 Slicing: Slicing is used to obtain a sequence of elements.
5.
Strings are ordered sequences of character data. 
Indexing allows us to access individual characters in a string directly by using a numeric.
6.
In Python, Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. However, Python does not have a character data type, 
a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
7.
Using the + operator is the most common way to concatenate two strings in Java. we can provide either a variable, 
a number, or a String literal (which is always surrounded by double quotes).
8.
Use str. index() to find the first occurrence of a substring in a string.
 Call str. index(substr) with substr as the target substring in the string str .
9.
The logical operators and, or and not are also referred to as boolean operators. 
While and as well as or operator needs two operands, which may evaluate to true or false, not operator needs one operand evaluating to true or false.
 Boolean and operator returns true if both operands return true.
